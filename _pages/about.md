# Welcome

As a Postdoctoral Associate at Duke University working in the lab of [Michael Zavlanos](https://www.michaelmzavlanos.org/group), I lead efforts in the development of new theories, algorithms, and software for the analysis of networked autonomous systems, including the development of relevant data-driven and machine learning techniques. I interact with and supervise graduate and undergraduate students in our group working on relevant research topics.

My other research interests are geometric and topological deep learning, applied algebra, and applied topology.
