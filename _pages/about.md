# Welcome

As a Postdoctoral Associate at Duke University working in the lab of [Michael Zavlanos](https://www.michaelmzavlanos.org/group), I lead efforts in the development of new theories, algorithms, and software for the analysis of networked autonomous systems, including the development of relevant data-driven and machine learning techniques. I interact with and supervise graduate and undergraduate students in our group working on relevant research topics.

My other research interests include multi-agent systems, geometric deep learning, lattice theory and applied topology.
