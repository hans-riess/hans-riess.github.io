## About My Research

I an applied algebraist in the sense that I port tools from algebra (e.g. lattice theory, homological algebra) and sometimes topology (simplicial complexes) to multi-agent systems.

Much of my research is centered around the [**Tarski Laplacian**](https://hansriess.com/files/tarski-laplacian.pdf), an operator inspired by the combinatorial Hodge Laplacian (maybe going back to De Rahm but certainly Eckmann). For the category theorists in the room, the Tarski Laplacian over a graph is a categorification of the graph Laplacian matrix. But it is so much more, as I explain in the video below...

I am on the **job market** looking for a position (post-doc, assistant professor or industry) starting as soon as August 2022.
